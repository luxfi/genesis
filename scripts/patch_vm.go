// This is a patch to help the VM recognize migrated data properly
// The issue is that when LUX_IMPORTED_HEIGHT is set, the VM should use NewMigratedBackend
// but it's still receiving a normal genesis that causes conflicts

// To fix this, we need to patch the VM initialization in vm.go around line 328
// When hasMigratedData is detected from environment variables,
// we should set genesis = nil and ensure we call NewMigratedBackend

// The patch should be:
// 1. After detecting LUX_IMPORTED_HEIGHT at line 124-144
// 2. When hasMigratedData is true and we're parsing genesis at line 328
// 3. Skip the normal genesis parsing and set genesis = nil
// 4. This will ensure we hit the NewMigratedBackend path at line 508

// Here's the key section that needs patching in vm.go:

/*
Line 327-333 should become:

} else if hasMigratedData {
    // PATCH: When we have migrated data from environment variables,
    // don't parse the genesis JSON - it will conflict with our migrated data
    vm.ctx.Log.Info("Skipping genesis parsing due to migrated data")
    genesis = nil
} else {
    // Normal genesis parsing
    genesis = &gethcore.Genesis{}
    if err := json.Unmarshal(genesisBytes, genesis); err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("failed to unmarshal genesis: %w", err)
    }
}
*/

// This ensures that when we have migrated data detected via environment variables,
// we don't try to apply a conflicting genesis configuration
